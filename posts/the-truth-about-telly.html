            <p>Paul: Richard, I guess you don’t watch much TV or films! Laurence Fox is related to Emilia, Edward and James (heard of them?) He appeared most recently as Lord Palmerston in the BBC’s Victoria.</p>
            <p>Richard: How dare you, sir!</p>
            <p>There have been vast swathes of my life without a TV. Around 1990 my oldest daughter almost knocked a little boy senseless in a small park in Islington, as he ran across the path of her swing. His father, a chap called Hugh Laurie, came over to thank me for my quick reaction. “What do you do?” I asked innocently as we pushed our offspring together, keeping the pendulum effect going, despite friction, according to the laws of physics. “What, adverts and stuff?” was my next query. “Ah, Blackadder. I used to play first slip at prep school to Richard Curtis as wicketkeeper.” Hugh was very amused by the last detail but also seemed pleased to be so comprehensively unrecognised. The next weekend was the only other time I ever saw him. At the swings again. “I checked you out – you are a real actor.” “I didn’t check you out – I don’t know if you’re a real software consultant.” “Don’t worry, there’s no such thing.”</p>
            <p>Fast forward to last year and I was having a meal in the South West with the same daughter. We got chatting about our favourite TV programmes and I confessed that my affections had moved decisively from Have I Got News For You to Would I Lie To You. “In the age of fake news, it’s the only show that makes sense.” She seemed to really like that rationale.</p>
            <p>And, of course, through WILTY I got to know Emilia Fox, said to be a relation of Basil Brush by the host Rob Brydon. Beautiful and witty – but whatever lie or truth she got given didn’t make the cut. So of course I know the Fox acting dynasty. But Lawrence and his no doubt stalwart efforts in Lewis on ITV had escaped me.</p>
            <p>Normal service may well be resumed shortly.</p>
