            <p>&quot;We asked BMW for some development devices&quot; -- Paddy Byers at <a href="http://lnug.org/">LNUG</a> tonight. His <a href="https://github.com/paddybyers/anode">fascinating work</a> under his own steam getting Node.js to work on Android has recently picked up funding from Webinos, the EU project for cross platform apps, which is partly bankrolled by BMW. The German car maker is already using Android as an embedded operating system in some of its latest models, so the gathered Node experts though it a bit stingy that they didn&#39;t supply a single &#39;Android device&#39; for testing by Paddy and team. But a great initiative and, as Byers emphasized, something that could not have worked for him without everything else in the stack - V8, Android and Node itself - being open source before it.</p>
